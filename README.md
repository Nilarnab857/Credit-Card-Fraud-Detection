This project aims to develop a robust Credit Card Fraud Detection system using advanced Machine Learning techniques. A fraud detection model was built using logistic regression in Python, leveraging historical transaction data to identify suspicious activity. The model achieved an accuracy of 95.23% using a proven binary classification method, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
